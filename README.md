# PyBullet Shenanigans

This repository is entirely for me to gain experience with the PyBullet dynamics/kinematics engine for use in Robotics and AI applications.

While I primarily work in ROS/Gazebo, I think it's important to understand the capabilities of PyBullet along with the other leading simulations in edge-AI research (Isaac and MuJoCo).
